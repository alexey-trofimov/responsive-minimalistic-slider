### Some notes:

The project uses the following colors:

*Light mode*:

- Body bg: #ffffff
- Hover/Active: #5050ff
- Content: #242428
- Metadata: #80808e

*Dark mode*:

- Body bg: #2e2e32
- Hover/Active: #7171ff
- Content: #ffffff
- Metadata: #a8a8b6

*Image size*:

- Original: 750x480px
- 2x: **1500x960px** (*recommended*)

*Google fonts*: Lora (400, 500, 600, 400 italic, 500 italic, 600 italic).

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to use this slider if you want to bring it into your project, as applying this prefix will reduce the chance that this slider's styles will conflict with your project's styles.
